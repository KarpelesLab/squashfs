# SquashFS format

Some documentation is available online on SquashFS.

## Directories

It turns out no documentation is available for directory tables.

SquashFS documentation starts with:

	Directories are organised in a slightly complex way, and are not simply
	a list of file names.

It seems likely no documentation is available out there (pending further research).
